## 🎯 How to Use

### Symbol Shortcuts
Type a `/` followed by the symbol name anywhere in the editor:
```
/alpha  →  α
/sum    →  ∑
/sqrt   →  √
/right  →  →
/1/2    →  ½
```

### Calculator Custom Functions
In the Calculator panel, define a function:
```
bmi(w, h) = w / h^2
```
Then use it directly in the Data Lab:
```
=bmi(70, 1.75)   →   22.86
```

## 💡 What I Learned

This was my first programming project, built with the help of AI (Claude by Anthropic). Through building this, I learned:

- How to structure a JavaScript project across multiple files
- How to use `localStorage` for data persistence
- How to integrate third-party libraries (Math.js, Chart.js)
- How to debug using browser DevTools and console
- How ES Modules and script loading order works
- How to iteratively build and improve features

## 📌 Future Improvements

- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Dark/Light theme toggle improvements
- [ ] More chart customization options
- [ ] Collaborative editing (backend)
- [ ] Sinhala language UI option
